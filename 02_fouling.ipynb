    "In FIBA 3x3, fouling is a tactic used to prevent the offensive team from scoring easy baskets when the defending team has less than 7 fouls. For fouls 1 to 6, there is no free throw awarded to the team that was fouled unless the foul occured on a shot. For fouls 7 to 9, two free throws are awarded to the fouled team and for fouls 10 and above, two free throws plus possession of the ball are awarded to the fouled team. "
